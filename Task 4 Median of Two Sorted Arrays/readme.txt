This solution uses a binary search approach to find the correct partition of the two sorted arrays. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:
We ensure that nums1 is the smaller array to simplify the algorithm.
We perform a binary search on the smaller array to find the correct partition.
For each partition of nums1, we calculate the corresponding partition of nums2.
We compare the elements around the partition to check if we've found the correct median position.
If the partition is correct, we calculate and return the median.
If not, we adjust the binary search range and continue.
This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log(min(m,n))), which satisfies the required O(log(m+n)) complexity.
The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
This solution handles all the given constraints and examples correctly. It also throws an exception if the input arrays are not sorted, which is an implicit assumption of the problem.

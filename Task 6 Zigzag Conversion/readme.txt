This solution works as follows:
If numRows is 1, we return the original string as there's no zigzag pattern to create.
We create a vector of strings rows to store characters for each row.
We iterate through each character in the input string:
Add the character to the current row.
Change direction (going down or up) when we reach the top or bottom row.
Move to the next row based on the direction.
Finally, we concatenate all the rows to get the result.
This approach has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input string, as we iterate through each character once. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the characters in the rows vector.
